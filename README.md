# Glioma Studies

This repository contains analysis code for molecular assays performed as part of investigations into the mechanisms of glioma risk associated with inherited genetic variants.

## Luciferase Assays
* Boxplots
* Generalized estimating equations tests
* Chromosome 9
* Chromosome 20

## RNA-seq
* Samples 1-14 for chrom9
* Samples 15-28 for chrom20
* U87 and U118 for chrom9
* U87 and LN229 for chrom20
* Parental lines excluded

## SNPs
* Chromosome 20: rs3761124
* Chromosome 9: rs1537372, rs1537373, and rs1333042
